# Crisis Cleanup

Crisis Cleanup is a collaboration platform that connects disaster recovery organization volunteers with people who need help after a disaster. The Crisis Cleanup platform has been used to connected 617,730 volunteers from 1,684 organizations with 80,707 households in 48 states/provinces and 141 disasters in 7 countries; a new disaster every two weeks.

Crisis Cleanup works best in a collaborative environment where multiple voluntary organizations and agencies work together and coordinate efforts. Because these organizations do not take orders from one another, Crisis Cleanup is designed to facilitate Collaborative Accountability models of inter-agency interaction, rather than command-and-control operations, or or heirarchical accountability models of interaction. 

This is the repository for the V.3 Crisis Cleanup web application, which is currently under development. The current version, V.2 is available at: https://github.com/CrisisCleanup/crisiscleanup-2
